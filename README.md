## **Overview**
The project that we were working on was creating an a financial dashboard that showed indices and exhanged-traded funds (etfs) prices over time between 2018 and 2021.  This was done by creating a database in PGAdmin and then using a Flask API that would establish a connection with the PostgreSQL database and then defining the routes to the different indices and ETFs. The visualizations are then created using Javascript. The purpose of our project is to compare different funds and how they are changing with time and to give users a friendly interface to see those changes. 
## **Interaction**
To interact with the project, you can use the dropdown menu next to each of three different visualizations. These visualizations show you the trends of the prices of the indices and etfs over time.Using the dropdown, the user can select the specific index or etf they want to analyze and isolate that chart. The user could also select multiple funds or indices if the user would like to compare 2 or more specific trends. This would be helpful in seeing if multiple trends follow the same rises and falls due to different socioeconomic effects, such as Covid or a market crash
## **Ethical Considerations**
Our ethical considerations were referencing our sources and ensuring that we were not sharing private information. We did this by cross-checking with Kaggle that it was allowed to be used as a source. Since we are using publicly accessible data from etfs and indices, we were not worried that we would be commiting any ethical and/or legal violations. However, we still double check our work and by doing this we were able to conclude that our data was public information and safe to share.
